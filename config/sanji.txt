However, where this artwork was taken?


Chapter 876 of One Piece continues the Whole Cake Island saga, which began 50 chapters ago with Sanji's kidnapping and introduced stunning fairytale settings and eccentric characters. Big Mom remains unstoppable, especially during her eating disorders, as seen when the Nami-Zeus attack fails to harm her. The Straw Hats waste critical moments debating her defeat instead of gaining ground. A standout moment is Big Mom breaking through the ground, showcasing her raw power. 

Meanwhile, Sanji's rare, sinister demeanor hints at a plan involving a special cake to weaken Big Mom, though it may clash with his values as a chef. If this cake simply leads to the Straw Hatsâ€™ escape, it could feel like a letdown in storytelling.
